##Deep Learning With Neural Network Code##

Wk1 : Vectorization

Wk 2 code : Application of simple logistic Regression on image data 

Wk 3: Application of Shallow Neural Network on Cat image data:
**Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
**Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
**Compute the cross entropy loss
**Implement forward and backward propagation

Wk 4: 
Assignment 1 : Create Deep Neural Network with L Layers:
Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
Implement an easy-to-use neural network class


Assignment 2: Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application
To build your cat/not-a-cat classifier, you'll use the functions from the previous assignment to build a deep network. Hopefully, you'll see an improvement in accuracy over your previous logistic regression implementation.

After this assignment you will be able to:

Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning
